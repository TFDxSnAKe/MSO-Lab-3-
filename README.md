This program has 3 example programs: Basic, Advanced, Expert. These can be found under 'Load Program' -> 'Example Program' at the top of the screen. 
There is also the ability to load in your own programs with 'Open Program...' (or Ctrl + N), which must be a .txt file, and you can save the current program with the 'Save Program' button (or Ctrl + S).

These have been slightly altered to fit the grid size that we have (6x6) and to show possible implementations of the new commands.

You can also load in 3 different pathfinding exercises: Easy, Medium and Hard. These can be found under 'Pathfinding Exercises' at the top of the screen

Programs can be executed by clicking on the 'Execute Program' button. Once pressed, the output trace will be show in output textbox on the right and a visualisation of the player's position in the grid as well as the path the player took will be drawn.

The current program's metrics can be calculated by clicking on the 'Calculate Metrics' button, which will display the metrics in the output textbox. These metrics are:
  - No. of valid commands
  - No. of invalid commands
  - Maximum nesting
  - No. of repeats
  - No. of RepeatUntil
